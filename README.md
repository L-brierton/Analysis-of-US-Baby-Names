# Analysis of US Baby Names

I analysed the trends in US Baby names from 1946 to 2016. Dataset is found here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data

The dataset came in 70 plain text files. I began by adding the year (found in the title of the text file) as a column to each of the text files, then I compiled these files into one large text file. Finally, I transferred that data into a CSV file. This is the file I will analyse.

There were 3 questions I wanted to answer:
  - The changes in the usage of names over time
  - Analysis of unisex names and their prevalence
  - The changes in the most popular names over time
