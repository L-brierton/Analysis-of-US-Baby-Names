# Analysis of US Baby Names

I analysed the trends in US Baby names from 1946 to 2016. Dataset is found here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data

The dataset came in 70 plain text files. I began creating a Dataframe consisting of the name, sex, number and year (found in the title of the text file) then I transferred that DataFrame into a CSV file.

I then analysed the data with 3 questions in mind:
  - The changes in the usage of names over time
  - Analysis of unisex names and their prevalence
  - The changes in the most popular names over time
